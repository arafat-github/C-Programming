    /* The general rules for naming variable are:
    .) Names can contain letters, digits and underscores
    .) Names must begin with a letter or an underscore (_)
    .) Names are case-sensitive (myVar and myvar are different variable)
    .) Names cannot contain whitespaces or special characters like !,#,@,% etc.
    .) Reserved words ( such as int) cannot be used as variable names
